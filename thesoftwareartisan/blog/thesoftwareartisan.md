An artisan is someone who is skilled in a specific trade. Different people imagine different things when picturing artisans; I think of a blacksmith. This blacksmith takes their time to render each piece to their satisfaction. In order for the end product to be good enough, it must be practical, functional, durable, and elegant.

In software development, there tends to be an emphasis on practicality and functionality while durability and elegance get thrown by the wayside. This happens for a myriad of reasons, but the most common reasons I've witnessed are lack of planning or time.

When I create software, I see myself as a blacksmith. Every line of code is purposeful just like every strike of a blacksmith's hammer. Just like the blacksmith, I know it is best to do things the right way the first time.

I call myself a software artisan because I have an artisan's dedication to my craft. I do not compromise on quality. Like the blacksmith, I require my solutions to be practical, functional, durable, and elegant.
